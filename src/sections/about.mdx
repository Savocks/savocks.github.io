I'm Giulio Savoca.
I was born in 1997 in Palermo, Sicily.
I fell in love with computer science when I was young,
messing around with the first PC games.

I later studied computer science in high school and at the end I started working with JavaScript and I never
stopped

I am a people person, I like to work in a team and with beautiful people, always learning new things and
applying them in projects to give the customer added value.
I always give my best and put a lot of dedication into what I do
